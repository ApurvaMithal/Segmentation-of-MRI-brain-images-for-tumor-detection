Project Title: Segmentation of MRI brain images for tumor detection.
	    	              	             
Language Used: Matlab    
                                                                                                                 
Implemented image segmentation algorithms on MRI brain images to separate similar portions of the image based on gray-level values of the pixels. The purpose of segmenting the MRI brain images was to help in tumor detection. Segmentation techniques implemented were edge-based segmentation (Krisch, Sobel), threshold-based segmentation (Ostu), clustering algorithms (k-means, adaptive k-means, fuzzy c-means, Marker Controlled Watershed).
